# Startup-Success-Prediction
A startup or start-up is a company or project begun by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable economic model. Startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential. Some startups become unicorns: privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. [Source of information: Wikipedia]

The goal is to predict whether a startup which is currently operating turns into a success or a failure. The success of a company is defined as the event that gives the company's founders a large sum of money through the process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). A company would be considered as failed if it had to be shut down.
